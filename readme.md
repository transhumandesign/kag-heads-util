# kag-heads-utils

A small utility to work with and preview kag custom head files, requires love2d 11+

Developed to render out batches of heads for rating and ensuring compilance of the first community head pack entries,
but may be useful for previewing heads that you are working on.

## Usage

simply run the root of the project with love, either by dragging the folder onto your love binary,
or from the commandline with something resembling the following:

```sh
love .
```

Heads files in the correct format (see the examples in [kag-base](https://github.com/transhumandesign/kag-base/blob/master/Entities/Characters/Sprites/CustomHeads/)) can be dragged onto the window to instantly preview them on all classes.

## TODO

Pre-packaged versions for some operating systems may be provided in future if needed, just ask.

Archer attacking preview is missing as it requires multiple layered sprites and wasn't considered very important in this context.
